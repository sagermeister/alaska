WIP - Alaska Survival Game

Text Based Survival Game
coded in Python

Still needs a lot of work, just did it to kill time and practice what I learned from SoloLearn (which isn't much...)

To run: | Go to console | Go to directory (example: "cd /Desktop") | Type: "python3 alaska.py" | Hit 'Enter' Button | Enjoy
